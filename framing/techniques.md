# Scientific Theories in Practice

## 1. George Lakoff - Cognitive Frames

### Theory
People understand politics through metaphors and frames. When you activate a frame, you activate 
its associated values and emotions.

### PS's Frames

**"Finland is Home"**
- Home must be safe
- You decide who enters your home
- Home is cared for
- Example: "We don't lock our doors out of hostility, but to protect our family"

**"People are Family"**
- Finns are one big family
- Family members come first
- Same rules for everyone
- Example: "A good parent takes care of their own children first"

**"State is Business"**
- Economy must be balanced
- Can't spend more than you earn
- Efficiency and results
- Example: "Finland Ltd. must stay competitive"

### Practical Application
1. Choose a frame that supports your argument
2. Use words and expressions that fit the frame
3. Avoid reinforcing opponent's frames
4. Repeat your frame consistently

## 2. Jonathan Haidt - Moral Psychology

### 6 Moral Foundations + Liberty/Oppression

**1. Care/Harm**
- PS: "We protect Finnish children and elderly"
- Use: Security arguments, social security

**2. Fairness/Cheating** (MOST IMPORTANT IN FINLAND)
- PS: "Is it fair that hard workers pay for the lazy?"
- Use: Almost all arguments

**3. Loyalty/Betrayal**
- PS: "Finland first, Finns first"
- Use: Patriotism, EU criticism

**4. Authority/Subversion**
- PS: "Defending law and order"
- Use: Crime, immigration

**5. Sanctity/Degradation**
- PS: "Preserving Finnish culture"
- Use: Culture, traditions

**6. Liberty/Oppression** (additional dimension)
- PS: "Freedom from EU-dictated policy"
- Use: EU criticism, bureaucracy
- Note: Works as support in Finland, not main argument

### Practical Use
- Identify target audience's most important moral foundations
- Build argument on multiple foundations
- Fairness always works in Finland

## 3. Daniel Kahneman - Cognitive Biases

### Exploitable Biases

**Availability Heuristic**
- Use vivid, concrete examples
- "Remember when in Turku..."
- Bring abstract things close

**Confirmation Bias**
- Reinforce existing beliefs
- "As we've always said..."
- Provide evidence that supports preconceptions

**Loss Aversion**
- "What we lose if we don't act"
- More effective than emphasizing gains
- "Finnish welfare is in danger"

**Anchoring**
- Set discussion starting points
- "When immigration costs X billion..."
- First number sticks in mind

### Practical Tips
- Use System 1 thinking (fast, intuitive)
- Emotions before facts
- Simple messages

## 4. Robert Cialdini - Principles of Influence

### Six Principles in PS's Use

**1. Reciprocity**
- "PS has advocated for your issues for years"
- "We've worked for ordinary Finns"

**2. Commitment and Consistency**
- "You who have always valued honesty..."
- Small steps toward bigger acceptance

**3. Social Proof**
- "More and more Finns have noticed..."
- "PS support is growing because..."

**4. Liking**
- Relatability: "ordinary Finn"
- Familiarity: repeat same themes

**5. Authority**
- Reference statistics and research
- "According to the professor..."

**6. Scarcity**
- "Last chance to save..."
- "If we don't act now..."

## 5. Drew Westen - The Political Brain

### Emotion-Based Argumentation

**Structure**
1. Emotional connection first
2. Story that resonates
3. Facts to support emotion
4. Call to action

**Example:**
"Maija, 75, queued at the health center for 6 hours (emotion). Meanwhile... (story). 
Statistics show... (fact). That's why PS demands... (action)."

### Power of Narratives
- Beginning: Problem/threat
- Middle: Why this happened
- End: PS's solution

## Integrated Model

1. **Choose moral foundation** (Haidt) - usually fairness
2. **Activate frame** (Lakoff) - e.g., "Finland is home"
3. **Create emotional connection** (Westen) - story or example
4. **Use influence principles** (Cialdini)
5. **Leverage cognitive shortcuts** (Kahneman)

This creates an argument that works on both rational and emotional levels.
