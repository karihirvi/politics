# CLAUDE_SYNTAX_EN.md - Syntactic Constraints for Finnish Political Communication

## Overview

This document defines precise grammatical constraints for each of the seven political communication styles. These constraints are based on statistical analysis of real examples and provide Claude with concrete parameters for optimization.

## Using Syntactic Constraints

Each style includes:
1. **Sentence Type Distribution** - Percentage breakdown of different sentence types
2. **Sentence Length Distribution** - Word count per sentence
3. **Subject Types** - How subjects are expressed
4. **Predicate Structures** - Verb usage patterns
5. **Clause Structures** - Main and subordinate clause relationships

## 1. ORATORY STYLE - Syntactic Constraints

### Sentence Type Distribution
```
Imperative sentences:    40-60%  ("Ole mies!", "Herää Suomi!")
Declarative sentences:   30-40%  (facts and beliefs)
Exclamatory sentences:   15-25%  ("Tuhat tulimmaista!", "Voi ristus!")
Interrogative sentences: 5-15%   (rhetorical questions)
```

### Sentence Length Distribution
```
1-5 words:     20-30%  ("Ole mies!", "Riittää nyt!")
6-10 words:    35-45%  ("Suomi tarvitsee sinua juuri nyt.")
11-15 words:   20-25%  (medium explanatory sentences)
16+ words:     5-10%   (rare long sentences)

Average sentence length: 8-12 words
```

### Subject Types
```
You (direct address):           25-35%

## Instructions for Claude

1. **Select style** before writing
2. **Count sentence types** - ensure distributions match constraints
3. **Measure sentence lengths** - keep average in correct range
4. **Check subjects** - use appropriate subject types
5. **Vary structures** - but stay within style-specific limits
6. **Repeat as needed** - especially in populist and oratory styles
