# CLAUDE_POST_EN.md - Guide for Writing Individual Posts

## Overview

This document provides Claude with detailed instructions for creating effective individual social media posts in the Finnish political context. It complements CLAUDE_STYLE_EN.md and CLAUDE_GOAL_EN.md documents by focusing specifically on single post writing techniques.

## Post Length Variation

### CRITICAL: Vary Lengths Significantly

Posts must vary dramatically in length to maintain audience engagement:

**Short Strike** (1-2 paragraphs, 2-5 lines)
- Suitable for: Populist, Critical-Political
- Use: Quick reactions, simple messages
- Example: "There are two genders. Everything else is a lie."

**Medium Analysis** (3-4 paragraphs, 10-15 lines)
- Suitable for: Argumentative, Conceptual
- Use: Justifications, brief explanations
- Example: e002-pukeutumispakko-burkaan.txt

**Long Deep Dive** (5-8 paragraphs, 20-40 lines)
- Suitable for: Analytical, Philosophical-Religious
- Use: Comprehensive analyses, emotional narratives
- Example: e005-sisu.txt

**Extra-Long Manifesto** (10+ paragraphs, 40+ lines)
- Suitable for: Oratory, Analytical
- Use: Strategic openings, foundational texts
- Example: e001-vaestonvaihto-termi.txt

### Length Selection by Style

```
Style                    | Short | Medium | Long | Extra-Long
-------------------------|-------|--------|------|------------
Oratory                 | ✓     | ✓✓     | ✓✓✓  | ✓

Argumentative           | ✓     | ✓✓✓    | ✓    | -
Critical-Political      | ✓✓✓   | ✓✓     | -    | -

Populist                | ✓✓✓   | ✓      | -    | -
```

## Structural Elements

### 1. Opening Power

**Immediate Hook** - First sentence decides everything
- Question: "How much longer will we wait?"
- Statement: "Cheap energy is a human right."
- Fact: "There are two genders."
- Challenge: "It's time to take responsibility."

**Context Creation** - Only after the hook
- Brief explanation of why this matters NOW
- Connection to reader's daily life or emotions

### 2. Paragraph Structure

**Short Paragraphs** (1-3 sentences)
- Facilitates mobile reading
- Creates rhythm and pace
- Emphasizes core messages

**Empty Line Between Paragraphs**
- Always, without exception
- Creates visual space
- Facilitates scanning

### 3. Argumentation Building

**Rule of Three**
- Present maximum 3 main arguments per post
- Each argument in its own paragraph
- Order: Strongest first, second strongest last

**Concreteness**
- Always examples: "Last week in Helsinki..."
- Numbers: "In 15 European countries..."
- Comparisons to everyday life: "You pay every day..."

### 4. Emotional Registers

**Emotional Arc Within Post**
1. Awaken emotion (worry, anger, hope)
2. Reinforce with fact or example
3. Direct to action or thinking

**Emotional Intensity Variation**
- Don't maintain same intensity throughout
- Alternate: Dramatic → Calm → Dramatic

## Linguistic Style

### 1. Word Choices

**Active Verbs**
- "Demand", "Act", "Change" (not "should", "could")
- Present tense: "You pay" (not "you would pay")
- Imperative for calls to action

**Concrete Nouns**
- "burqa" (not "clothing choice")
- "money" (not "economic resources")
- "Finns" (not "citizens")

### 2. Sentence Structures

**Variation is Critical**
- Short sentence. Another short one.
- Then a longer sentence that explains and justifies what was said earlier.
- Short again.

**Rhetorical Devices**
- Repetition: "Cheaper gas, cheaper diesel, cheaper electricity."
- Rule of three: "Banks, shops, offices - all..."
- Contrasting pairs: "No demonstrations needed. Your voice is needed."

### 3. Voice and Persona

**Consistent Persona**
- Decide at start: Authority / Rebel / Teacher / Fighter
- Maintain same persona throughout post
- Change persona only in next post

## Special Techniques

### 1. "Lie Deconstruction" Technique

Structure:
1. Present opponent's claim in quotes
2. Deconstruct claim with facts
3. Offer alternative frame

Example:
```
"Freedom of choice," they say.
But where is 15-year-old Fatima's freedom of choice...
```

### 2. "Cost Concretization" Technique

Structure:
1. Abstract policy → Concrete cost
2. "You pay" repetition
3. Simple solution

### 3. "Historical Continuum" Technique

Structure:
1. Appeal to past: "Our grandparents..."
2. Present crisis
3. Future threat/promise

## Formatting Guidelines

### Text Layout

**NO hashtags** - Never, in any context

**NO links within text** - They disrupt reading

**Empty line between paragraphs** - Always

**Bold and Italics**
- Use sparingly
- Only 1-2 keywords per post
- Never entire sentences

### Special Characters and Punctuation

**Ellipsis (...)**
- To create tension
- To suggest thought continuation
- Max 2 times per post

**Exclamation Marks (!)**
- Max 2-3 per post
- Not consecutively!!!
- Works best in short sentences

**Question Marks (?)**
- Rhetorical questions at post beginning
- To challenge reader thinking

## Style-Specific Features in Posts

### Oratory Style
- Start dramatically
- Use "we" and "our"
- End with call to action
- Length: Medium-Long

### Analytical
- Start with fact or statistic
- Build logical argument
- End with conclusion
- Length: Long-Extra Long

### Populist
- Start with everyday problem
- Offer simple solution
- Repeat core message
- Length: Short-Medium

### Critical-Political
- Start with revelation
- Name the guilty
- Demand accountability
- Length: Short-Medium

## Checklist Before Publishing

1. **Length**: Significantly different from previous post?
2. **Hook**: Does first sentence make reader stop?
3. **Clarity**: Does average person understand immediately?
4. **Emotion**: Does post evoke feeling?
5. **Action**: Clear what reader should think/do?
6. **Language**: Concrete and active?
7. **Formatting**: Empty lines in place? No hashtags?

## Example Analysis

**e011-halpa-energia.txt - Populist Masterpiece**

Why it works:
1. **Hook**: "Cheap energy is a human right" - Surprising, concrete
2. **Structure**: Short paragraphs, clear rhythm
3. **Repetition**: "Cheaper" x3, "reduce" x4
4. **Concreteness**: Finland's emissions 0.1%
5. **Metaphor**: "mouse", "elephant", "human-sized"
6. **Ending**: Call to action + slogan

Lesson: Populist style works best as medium-length, concrete, and utilizing repetition.
