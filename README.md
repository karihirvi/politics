# Political Communication Engineering System

A systematic approach to engineering effective political communication in the Finnish context.

## The Philosophy of Communication Engineering

Traditional political communication has been treated as an art form—relying on intuition, charisma, and trial-and-error. This repository represents a paradigm shift: treating political communication as an engineering discipline where messages can be systematically designed, optimized, and refined based on measurable constraints and proven patterns.

At its core, communication engineering is an optimization problem: humans define goals, machines use optimization to create messages that, when read by humans, produce maximal effect in advancing toward those goals. While humans are far more than reactive machines, for the purpose of persuasion modeling, we can approximate audience responses as another language model—one that responds statistically to certain linguistic and emotional patterns. This doesn't mean deterministic responses, but rather probabilistic tendencies that can be measured and optimized.

Just as software engineering transformed programming from craft to discipline, communication engineering transforms political messaging from guesswork to science. By decomposing the complex challenge of persuasion into manageable layers of abstraction, we can optimize each component independently while ensuring they work together harmoniously.

## The Critical Role of Human Examples

No engineering system can function without empirical data. In communication engineering, the `style-examples/` folder serves as our training data—real messages that have proven effective in the Finnish political context. These examples are not mere inspiration; they are the ground truth that constrains and guides the optimization system.

The examples serve multiple purposes:
- **Validation**: Proof that certain approaches work with real audiences
- **Constraints**: Define the boundaries of acceptable and effective communication
- **Patterns**: Reveal linguistic and rhetorical structures that resonate
- **Metrics**: Provide measurable success indicators (views, engagement, impact)

Without these human-created examples, the system would be optimizing blindly. With them, it can learn what actually moves people to action.

## Why Abstraction Levels Matter

Complex systems require hierarchical organization. Just as a building needs architecture, structure, materials, and details, effective political communication requires multiple levels of planning and execution:

- **Without abstraction**: Writers get overwhelmed trying to juggle strategy, style, grammar, and word choice simultaneously
- **With abstraction**: Each level can be optimized independently, with clear interfaces between levels
- **Result**: More consistent, more effective, and more scalable communication

The abstraction hierarchy allows us to separate "what to say" from "how to say it" from "which words to use"—enabling systematic improvement at each level.

## How This System Works

This repository provides a multi-layered constraint system that enables AI tools (particularly Claude) to function as sophisticated optimization engines for political communication. By defining constraints at different abstraction levels, the system guides generation of highly targeted and effective political content.

### The Five Levels of Abstraction

#### Level 1: Strategic Goals (Highest Abstraction)
**Files:** `CLAUDE_GOAL_*.md`
- **Purpose**: Define what you want to achieve
- **Content**: Campaign objectives, psychological journey models, strategic sequences
- **Example**: "Convert skeptics to supporters" or "Mobilize base for action"

#### Level 2: Communication Styles
**Files:** `CLAUDE_STYLE_*.md`
- **Purpose**: Define how to communicate
- **Content**: 7 distinct political communication styles with unique characteristics
- **Example**: Oratory style for rallying, Analytical style for persuading intellectuals

#### Level 3: Rhetorical Structures
**Files:** `CLAUDE_RHETORIC_*.md`
- **Purpose**: Define argumentation patterns
- **Content**: Evidence types, framing methods, narrative arcs
- **Example**: Use emotional appeals 60%, logical arguments 40%

#### Level 4: Syntactic Patterns
**Files:** `CLAUDE_SYNTAX_*.md`
- **Purpose**: Define sentence construction
- **Content**: Sentence types, lengths, grammatical patterns
- **Example**: 40-60% imperative sentences for Oratory style

#### Level 5: Lexical Choices
**Files:** `CLAUDE_LEXICON_*.md`
- **Purpose**: Define word selection
- **Content**: Vocabulary, registers, key phrases
- **Example**: Use "sisu" and other cultural keywords in Oratory style

### The Optimization Flow

1. **Human Input**: Successful examples demonstrate what works
2. **Pattern Extraction**: System analyzes examples for linguistic patterns
3. **Constraint Definition**: Patterns become measurable constraints
4. **Goal Setting**: Human defines desired outcome
5. **Optimization**: System generates content maximizing goal achievement
6. **Human Feedback**: Results inform next iteration

## Getting Started

1. **Define your objective**: What political goal do you want to achieve?
2. **Consult the strategy guide**: `CLAUDE_GOAL_*.md` will map your objective to a campaign structure
3. **Review available styles**: `CLAUDE_STYLE_*.md` shows the tools in your toolkit
4. **Study examples**: The `style-examples/` folder contains battle-tested content
5. **Create iteratively**: Use the A-B file pattern to refine your message
6. **Let the system guide you**: Each abstraction level provides specific constraints

## Key Innovation

This system transforms political communication from intuitive art to systematic engineering by:
- Decomposing complexity into manageable layers
- Providing measurable constraints at each layer
- Enabling systematic optimization
- Creating reproducible results
- Allowing continuous improvement through iteration

## Language

- Finnish for actual political content
- English for system documentation
- Examples include both languages for maximum learning
