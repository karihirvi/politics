# Political Communication Engineering System

A systematic approach to engineering effective political communication in the Finnish context.

## Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive system for creating effective political communication content for the Finnish audience, particularly focused on the Perussuomalaiset (PS) party. It combines insights from political communication experts, psychology, and cultural studies into a systematic engineering framework.

## Core Philosophy

This system treats political communication as an engineering discipline rather than an art form. By decomposing the complex challenge of persuasion into manageable layers of abstraction, we can optimize each component independently while ensuring they work together harmoniously.

## Repository Structure

```
├── postaukset/        # Individual social media posts
├── puolueohjelmat/    # Party programs and source materials  
├── kehystys/          # Framing techniques and strategies
├── tyyliesimerkit/    # Proven effective examples
└── CLAUDE_*.md        # System specifications and constraints

## The Five Abstraction Levels

1. **Strategic Goals** (`CLAUDE_TAVOITE.md`) - Define what to achieve
2. **Communication Styles** (`CLAUDE_TYYLI.md`) - Define how to communicate
3. **Rhetorical Structures** (`CLAUDE_RETORIIKKA.md`) - Define argumentation patterns
4. **Syntactic Patterns** (`CLAUDE_SYNTAKSI.md`) - Define sentence construction
5. **Lexical Choices** (`CLAUDE_SANASTO.md`) - Define word selection

## Key Features

- **7 Political Communication Styles**: From oratory to analytical to populist
- **Iterative Development**: A-B file pattern for systematic refinement
- **Example-Driven**: Real successful posts guide the optimization
- **Constraint-Based**: Measurable parameters at each abstraction level
- **Finnish Context**: Culturally adapted for Finnish political discourse

## Usage

The system is designed to work with AI assistants (particularly Claude) to generate highly targeted and effective political content. Users describe their communication goals, and the system provides the appropriate style, constraints, and examples to create optimized messages.

## Language

- Finnish for all political content and user interactions
- English documentation available for international reference
- All generated content is in Finnish
