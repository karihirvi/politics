## Competitors' Weaknesses in Statistics

**National Coalition:**
- "Punishing drivers, criticizing meat consumption" (Environmental Program 2019)
- "Special attention to immigrant backgrounds" - what about native Finns?
- "Market economy is the best system" - what about its losers?

**RKP:**
- "Finland's most EU-friendly party" - whose interests does it serve?
- "Family reunification must be secured" - who ends up in Finland?
- "People move without barriers" - what about border security?
