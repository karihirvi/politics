# Long-term Narratives

**Updated based on party programs 2025-01**

## 1. Defender of Ordinary Finns

### Core Story
PS is the only party that truly understands and defends the interests of ordinary Finns. Other parties have become 
alienated from people's everyday life and serve either the elite, minorities, or global actors.

### Frame
"Us vs. elite" - PS represents the people, others represent the elite

### Supporting Arguments
- "Politicians don't understand what food prices mean to low-income earners"
- "Brussels gentlemen decide, ordinary Finns pay"
- "Media bubble doesn't see the real Finland"

### Concrete Examples
- Gas price increase and its impact in rural areas
- Health center queues vs. private doctors
- Lack of public transport in peripheral areas

### Usage
- Fits almost all situations
- Especially effective in economic issues
- Reinforces PS's identity as the people's party

## 2. Builder of Fair Finland

### Core Story
Finland was built on the principle of fairness, but in recent years fairness has disappeared. PS restores fairness 
to Finnish society - fair treatment for all Finns.

### Frame
"Restoring fairness" - things were better before, let's restore fairness

### Supporting Arguments
- "Is it fair that hard workers pay for the unemployed's lifestyle?"
- "Is it fair that immigrants get the same benefits immediately as those who paid taxes their whole life?"
- "Is it fair that Helsinki gets everything, countryside nothing?"

### Concrete Examples
- Social benefit abuse cases
- Tax injustices
- Service concentration in growth centers

### Usage
- Works especially well in social security discussions
- Appeals broadly to different population groups
- Easy to concretize

## 3. Guardian of Finnish Culture

### Core Story
Finnish culture and way of life are unique and valuable. PS is the only party that genuinely defends 
Finnishness against the pressures of globalization and multiculturalism.

### Frame
"Preserving Finnishness" - not xenophobia, but appreciation of one's own culture

### Supporting Arguments
- "Every nation has the right to its own culture"
- "Tolerance begins with appreciating one's own culture"
- "Without roots, a tree dies"

### Concrete Examples
- Status of Finnish language
- Traditional celebrations and customs
- National identity

### Usage
- In immigration discussions
- In education policy
- In EU issues

## 4. Guarantor of Security

### Core Story
Finns' security has weakened. PS is the only party that takes security threats seriously and is ready to 
make difficult decisions to protect Finns.

### Frame
"Security before political correctness"

### Supporting Arguments
- "We cannot close our eyes to problems"
- "Everyone should be able to move safely"
- "Law and order belong to everyone"

### Concrete Examples
- "Too lenient sentences for serious crimes" (Criminal Policy Program)
- "Foreign crime costs millions in prison expenses"
- "Hate speech laws restrict justified criticism" - freedom of speech in danger

### Usage
- In crime discussions
- In immigration issues
- In justice system reforms

## 5. Defender of Independent Finland

### Core Story
Finland's independence and self-determination are in danger due to EU's federal development. PS is the only party that 
genuinely defends national sovereignty.

### Frame
"Finland decides Finland's matters"

### Supporting Arguments
- "Our grandfathers didn't fight so Brussels could decide"
- "A small country needs its own voice"
- "In EU, Finland is a payer, not a decider"

### Concrete Examples
- EU contributions
- Effects of directives
- Decision-making shifting to Brussels

### Usage
- In EU issues
- In economic policy
- In foreign policy

## Combining Narratives

These narratives support each other and can be combined:
- Ordinary Finn + Fairness = "Fair politics for ordinary Finns"
- Culture + Security = "Secure Finland preserves its culture"
- Independence + Fairness = "Fair that Finland decides its own matters"

## Usage Guide

1. Choose narrative that fits the situation
2. Connect to current events
3. Use concrete examples
4. Always return to core story
5. Be consistent - don't switch narrative mid-argument
