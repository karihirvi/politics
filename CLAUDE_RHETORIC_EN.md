# CLAUDE_RHETORIC_EN.md - Rhetorical Constraints for Finnish Political Communication

## Overview

This document defines rhetorical structures and argumentation techniques for each of the seven political communication styles. Rhetoric operates between syntax and content, determining how arguments are constructed and presented.

## Levels of Rhetorical Constraints

1. **Argumentation Structures** - How claims are justified
2. **Evidence Types** - What kinds of proof are used
3. **Framing Methods** - How issues are presented
4. **Narrative Arcs** - What stories are told
5. **Rhetorical Devices** - Special techniques and patterns
